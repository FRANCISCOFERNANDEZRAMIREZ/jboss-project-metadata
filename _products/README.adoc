= Products XML Usage

Each XML file will be used by awestruct for loading product links for each product. It is suggested the name of each
file be the lowercase hyphenated name of the product (e.g. jboss-enterprise-application-platform.xml).

== Format

The format of the product xml files must follow the xsd file. Below is an example.

.jboss-enterprise-application-platform.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<product xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="file:/home/jporter/projects/jboss/jboss-developer-site/_products/products.xsd" name="jboss-enterprise-application-platform">
  <uses>
   <project org="jboss" name="errai"/>
   <spec org="jcp" name="jsr314"/>
   <spec org="jcp" name="jsr299"/>
   <project org="jboss" name="richfaces"/>
  </uses>
</product>
