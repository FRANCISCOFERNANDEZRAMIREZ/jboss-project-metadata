= Projects XML Usage

Each XML file will be used by awestruct for loading project links and descriptions for each project. It is suggested the name of each
file be the lowercase hyphenated (if needed) name of the organization running the project (e.g. red-hat.xml or apache.xml).

== Format

The format of the projects xml files must follow the xsd file. Below is an example.

.red-hat.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
